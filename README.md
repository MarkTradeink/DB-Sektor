Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Mark!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Music Projects and want to create my own label based on a NFT/Blockchain structure.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Javascript language and how GitHub works, this is all new for me :D
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on music projects and also trading projects. Maybe in the future I can collab in other stuff like videogames...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with code languages, Git, and how all the community of GitHub works
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about action sports, music projects, electronic hardware PCB's, siemens PLC's and all that similar stuff... I also can do translations in german or spanish. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email: @ dbsektorrecords@gmail.com or via Twitter @ www.twitter.com/MarkTradeink
